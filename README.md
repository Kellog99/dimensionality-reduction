# Dimensionality Reduction with Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
## Introduction

Welcome to this repository focused on dimensionality reduction using Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In this README, we'll discuss the problem of dimensionality reduction, introduce the concept of autoencoders, and explore the additional benefits brought by VAEs in capturing latent representations of data.
## The Problem of Dimensionality Reduction
### 1. Curse of Dimensionality

High-dimensional data often suffers from the curse of dimensionality, leading to increased computational complexity, storage requirements, and a decrease in the effectiveness of many machine learning algorithms. Dimensionality reduction aims to address these issues by transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving its essential characteristics.

### 2. Noise and Redundancy

High-dimensional datasets may contain noise and redundancy, making it challenging to extract meaningful patterns. Dimensionality reduction helps in filtering out irrelevant information, focusing on the most salient features, and improving the generalization performance of models.

## Autoencoder Model
### 1. Overview

An autoencoder is an unsupervised learning model that consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation, and the decoder reconstructs the original data from this representation. The network is trained to minimize the reconstruction error, encouraging the model to capture the most important features of the input.

### 2. Applications
Data Compression: Autoencoders can be used for compressing data, reducing its size while retaining important information.
Feature Learning: The encoder learns a compact representation of the input features, useful for downstream tasks like classification and clustering.

### 3. Getting Started

Explore the notebooks and code in the src directory to understand the implementation of autoencoders. Experiment with different architectures and datasets to observe how the model performs in reducing dimensionality.

## Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Model
### 1. Probabilistic Approach

VAEs extend the concept of autoencoders by introducing a probabilistic framework. Instead of producing a deterministic encoding, VAEs generate a probability distribution over possible encodings. This enables VAEs to capture the uncertainty in the data and generate diverse samples during decoding.

### 2. Latent Space Representation

VAEs model a latent space where each point corresponds to a potential data instance. This allows for smoother interpolation between data points and provides a continuous representation of the input space.

### 3. Applications
Generative Modeling: VAEs are powerful generative models capable of generating new samples similar to the training data.
Anomaly Detection: The probabilistic nature of VAEs makes them suitable for detecting anomalies in data.
